function [polygonal_mask, cropped_CellLabelIm] = PolygonCrop( imStack, CellLabelIm, polygonal_mask)
%POLYGONCROP provides an interactive polygon crop to reduce the segmented
%area of the image in case of extended wrong signal. Aim is to preserve the
%cell geometry and include all cells touched by the selection.
%
%IN: 
%   imStack     - image stack on which to draw the polygonal mask                                                               
%   CellLabelIm - image stack which contains the cell labels to crop
%   polygonal_mask - (optional) pre-existent mask to use for cropping 
%
% OUT: 
%   polygonal_mask - mask used for cropping the cell labels
%   cropped_CellLabelIm -> cropped cell lables (i.e. within the mask)
